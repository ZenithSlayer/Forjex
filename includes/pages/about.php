            <p>Who am i</p>
            <p>I'm some nerd that likes rpg and programing, i also need a good grade, so why not make a website that does all that (at least i think i'll get a good grade).</p>

            <p>Why does this exist</p>
            <p>As i said early, i need a good grade for collage, and i also really enjoy playing D&D, but i hate updating my dnd sheet, mostly because it now has the thinkness of toilet paper that you got from the bathroom from a gas-station in the middle of nowhere, so with this tool, i can store and update my characters easily.</p>

            <p>Why Forjex</p>
            <p>honestly? i liked how it sounded, and because heros are created in the heat of battle just like swords that are shaped in the anvil of a forge, i decided to make the icon a anvil, and the name forjex because we are in the internet and everything is indexed (also, the j is just for it to sound better in the promunciation)</p>
